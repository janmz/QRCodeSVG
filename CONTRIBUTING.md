### Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines to keep things smooth:

- Open an issue to discuss significant changes before starting work.
- Keep changes focused and incremental. One PR per logical change.
- Match existing code style (indentation, naming, comments).
- Ensure PHP 5.6+ compatibility unless otherwise discussed.
- Update or add examples if API or behavior changes.

#### Development

1. Run a local server: `php -S localhost:8000`
2. Open `test_varianten.php` in your browser for manual testing.

#### Commit messages

- Use concise, imperative subject lines: "Add rounded variant arc fixes".
- Reference issues when applicable.
